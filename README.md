> Can an AI-powered habit tracker significantly improve habit formation success rates compared to traditional manual habit trackers?

This repo tracks the progress of our AI-driven habit-tracking app, Habituate -  where decluttered plates meet organized workspaces. 

## Hypotheses
### Hypothesis 1
By analyzing images of meals, the AI-powered habit tracker will help users identify unhealthy food patterns and make more informed dietary choices. We expect to see a 20% increase in conscious decision-making regarding food for users receiving image-based feedback compared to traditional text-based logging.
### Hypothesis 2
The system's anomaly detection will identify early signs of disorganization or clutter in a user's workspace, potentially indicative of waning motivation. Users receiving these alerts will demonstrate a 15% improvement in workspace tidiness compared to those without alerts.

## Predictions
We predict that users of the AI-powered habit tracker will demonstrate the following:
- Increased self-awareness: Users will have a clearer understanding of the subtle visual patterns associated with successful habit execution and potential signs of decline.
- Early intervention: The anomaly detection system will identify potential setbacks early, allowing users to take proactive measures and course-correct.
- Higher success rates: Overall, users will experience greater success in forming and maintaining their desired habits.
